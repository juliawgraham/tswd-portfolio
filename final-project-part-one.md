# Importance of Testing in Software Development

## Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
While software testing is often overlooked by many, it is critical to a project's success.

### Project Structure
- Testing software is often overlooked
- Furthermore, when code is tested, it is not of high quality or even ignored 
- However, many software projects fail, with one major reason being lack of quality testing
- Testing also provides many other benefits to the developers and the project as a whole
- Call to action: advice and best practices for incorporating testing into the software development lifecycle.

### Understanding the Audience
The primary audience for this project are software developers, especially those who do overlook the importance of testing. Other members of the target audience include project managers and other high level managers of software projects. 

#### User Stories:
- As a software developer, I want to know if writing tests for my software is beneficial so I know how much time and resources I should allocate towards it. 
- As a project manager, I want to understand the importance of testing so I know how much of the project's time I should allocate towards it. 

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
