# Importance of Testing in Software Development

## Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
While software testing is often overlooked by many, it is critical to a project's success.

### Project Structure
- Testing software is often overlooked
- Furthermore, when code is tested, it is not of high quality or even ignored 
- However, many software projects fail, with one major reason being lack of quality testing
- Testing also provides many other benefits to the developers and the project as a whole
- Call to action: advice and best practices for incorporating testing into the software development lifecycle.

### Understanding the Audience
The primary audience for this project are software developers, especially those who do overlook the importance of testing. Other members of the target audience include project managers and other high level managers of software projects. 

#### User Stories:
- As a software developer, I want to know if writing tests for my software is beneficial so I know how much time and resources I should allocate towards it. 
- As a project manager, I want to understand the importance of testing so I know how much of the project's time I should allocate towards it. 

## Initial Sketches


# The Data
Most of the data used for this project will come from reports or research papers. The data collected therefore will usually be by hand from the various data visualizations and tables present in these sources. Since there is no centralized dataset, many sources will be used and more will be added as the project evolves. 

1. https://stevemcconnell.com/articles/upstream-decisions-downstream-costs/ 
- Contains a chart about the rising costs to correct a defect based on when it is detected and then corrected. 
2. https://cdn.activestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ActiveState-Developer-Survey-2019-Open-Source-Runtime-Pains.pdf?_ga=2.72822227.1964449080.1676299660-1241190181.1676299660
- Contains information about how software developers spend their time, including time spent on testing
3. https://content.microfocus.com/l/reduce-defects-software-tb?utm_source=techbeacon&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=7014J000000dVOkQAM&utm_term=keeplearning&utm_content=appdev&_ga=2.67739736.834447451.1676323379-801391211.1676323378
- Articles about how continuous integration and quality assurance can help projects
- This will be a good source for the call to action rather than for the data
4. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8116886
- Provides information about developer's beliefs about testing
- Findings were that tests were often not done, the tests were not of high quality, they were misguided about the amount of time spent on testing, and more.
5. https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2021/03/24/econImpactSumm.v23.pdf
- The financial cost of poor testing and how simple practices can dramatically decrease this cost.
6. https://about.gitlab.com/images/developer-survey/gitlab-devsecops-2021-survey-results.pdf
- GitLab survey about improvements to testing and DevOps practices
- Also includes anecdotes about developer's feelings towards testing
7. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6982627
- Common practices when writing unit tests and the problems that often plague them. 

# Method and Medium
I plan on primarily sketching my initial ideas by hand, both for data visualizations as well as the overall presentation. After sketching, I will primarily use Tableau for data visualization and Shorthand for the presentation. 

Outlined in a general schedule for this project:
- Gather more data sources
- Sketch more data visualizations based on those data sources
- Transfer all relevant data into excel spreadsheets
- Create digital data visualizations
- Design general wireframes focusing on the general layout
- Write a rough draft of the written content supporting the data visualizations 
- Finalize the story with a storyboard
- Conduct user research through interviews (multiple rounds)
- Incorporate user feedback
- Finalize all aspects of the presentation
- Present the final story
