# Visualizing Government Debt

**[Raw Data](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)**

## Background
"General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardized guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits."

## In 2021, US Debt-to-GDP Ratio was the 4th Highest in the World

### Analysis
Unlike the other two charts, the map provides geographical context for the debt-to-GDP ratio around the world in 2021. Since high debt is generally seen as a negative, a darker red was chosen for countries with higher debt while a lighter yellow highlighted countries with lower debt. Furthermore, this color spectrum includes a variety of colors, from very light yellows and mild oranges to dark reds and nearly blacks. This allows for easier contrast between countries with more similar ratio values. For countries with no values, a light gray was chosen so that the entire map was visible to provide context without detracting from the countries with data. A thin white outline was chosen to separate countries while again, not drawing much attention. When hovering over the countries with data, a tooltip appears with the country's name for context and the exact debt-to-GDP ratio (along with a corresponding marker on the legend) for those who are interested. 

The primary takeaway from this chart that would have been more difficult to see in the other charts was the relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio in eastern Europe, besides Greece, which had the 2nd highest ratio in the world. On the other hand, western Europe and North America (besides Mexico) had a comparably higher ratio. 

## Overall Analysis
Each of the 3 visualizing have their benefits and drawbacks. For the bar chart, it is relatively easy to compare the debt-to-GDP ratio (for 2021) between countries, especially when comparing the ratios between similar countries. This is because countries with a similar ratio are grouped together by proximity. Furthermore, by including the OCED average, it is easy to see which countries fall above and below this average. Finally, the red color quickly draws attention to the US. However, this map doesn't show how this ratio changes over time or provides any geographical context. 

For the grid of charts, the primary advantage is the ability to show how the debt-to-GDP ratio changes over time for the various countries. The dark red color provides color without drawing much attention. If these charts were all on the same chart, it would be easier to compare two countries; however, there would likely be so much overlap that it would be difficult to analyze one particular country as can be done with the grid of charts visualization.

Finally, for the map, the geographical context is provided. Similarly to the bar chart, the debt-to-GDP ratio can't be adequately shown over time; therefore, only the 2021 data is used again. However, unlike the bar chart, discerning the exact differences in color (especially for countries that are far apart) to be able to compare countries with similar ratios is difficult. The advantage this graph provides though is geographical context so, as shown in this chart, it is a lot easier to see the relatively low ratio in eastern Europe and how that starkly contrasts with Greece.
