# The Final Data Story
[Final data story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/c7d0a194-21f9-4cf8-a40d-0eb489e14d6c/)

# Changes Made Since Part II

The first change I made was adding citations so that all sources were properly acknowledged. Also, since one user mentioned how the chart legends were difficult to read because of the ellipses, I shortened the labels to ensure all text would be visible. Then, I highlighted the key statistics within the two stories in a bigger font and gold color, which emphasized the impact of these software project failures. 

A few users also mentioned that there was a lot of text, with one user specifically mentioning both the length of the next steps section as well as the redundant information between the charts and the text. For the next steps section, I decided to keep most of the information, but I made the bullet points more concise. To address the redundancy, I removed many of the percentages, so that the specific data would only be present within the charts. However, I ultimately decided to keep most of the redundancy, as the extra text helped the story flow and not feel like simply a series of somewhat related data visualizations. 

The final piece of user feedback that I focused on was how the story did not feel engaging for non technical readers. This was difficult to address, as I wanted to continue telling the original story of the importance of software testing. Since all 3 users I interviewed really enjoyed the two stories of major project failures, I decided make that the second, not third, section. While I did consider putting these two stories first, I felt as though the story of the importance of testing was more impactful when it began with an explanation of how testing is currently overlooked. Then, after setting the scene, the two major software project failures can engage the reader. Finally, to make the introduction more relatable, I decided to add a short paragraph at the beginning that highlights that the key takeaways from this story are applicable to all domains, as the problem of quality assurance being seen as lesser while still being critical to success is a general problem that many can relate to. 


## The Audience
My target audience continues to be primarily those working directly with software, whether they are software engineers or project managers. However, I also wanted this story to be interesting for non technical readers. As mentioned above and in Part II, the user feedback showed me that my original draft, while resonating with software engineers, was not engaging for non technical readers. Therefore, I introduced the engaging stories earlier and explicitly mentioned in the introduction how the importance of quality assurance is not unique to software. Finally, as was in the initial draft, the next steps section includes information that is applicable to a wider audience.


## Final Design Decisions
Besides the various design decisions I made when incorporating user feedback and working to make the presentation more engaging to a wider audience, I more generally strove to create an informative, engaging, clear story backed by data visualizations. Therefore, I decided on a neutral, clean color scheme of white, black, and gold with a modern, sans serif font and a monospaced accent font that is often used when programming. This, along with the use of big pictures, was something that all users mentioned that they enjoyed. 

For design changes, one early change I made was adding the stories about the software project failures. Initially, I only included these stories to help break up the monotony of small text boxes followed by minimal charts, and was hesitant to include them at all since there was little data I could effectively visualize. However, this decision proved to be instrumental to how the story was received by especially non technical readers. This showed me how important it is to try new things, because user feedback can often be surprising and go against initial intuitions. 


# Final Thoughts
Overall, I really enjoyed this project. Not only did I learn a lot about software testing, but I also learned how to use my existing data visualization skills to create an engaging story for a broad audience. The one wish I did have was to instead choose a story that had large data sets I could experiment with, as most of my visualizations ended up being simple donut charts and stacked bar charts. Having said that, this project did show me how to make the most out of minimal data scattered across various sources and how to make even the most simple visualizations engaging and informative.
