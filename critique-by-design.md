# Critique by Design


## Chosen Visualization

<img src="resources/Signal_Table_Data_Visualization.png" alt="Table" width="300"/>

The following visualization shows the user testing results performed by Wu et al. in the following research paper: ["Something isn't secure, but I'm not sure how that translate into a problem": Promoting autonomy by designing for understanding in Signal](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2019/presentation/wu). In summary, Wu et al. sought to demonstrate how their redesign of Signal's warning notifications improves user comprehension and empowers them "to make personal trade-offs between percieved risk and response cost." This data visualization is presented to showcase their positive findings.

## Critique

### Usefulness
**Score: 10**. Overall, this data visualization is very useful. Since this is a part of a research paper, the primary use of this table is for the authors to be able to back up their claims with concrete numbers. As mentioned in the paper, "This table reveals that comprehension of the purpose of the authentication ceremony and of the significance of matching and non-matching numbers visibly improved with our redesign." Therefore, by showing how more users recieved correct answers for their redesign when compared to Signal, this table adequately accomplishes the author's goals.

### Completeness
**Score: 4**. The completeness of this data visualiaztion depends on the audience. If the audience is someone who read the entire paper and sees this chart after being directed to it in the paper and given a thorough explanation (for example, 'see Table 2'), then the table is relatively complete. It shows, for the three types of questions asked, how many users, both actual numbers and percentages, answered correctly, partially correctly, and incorrectly for both designs. However, it would likely take the reader a few moments to realize that each of the three boxes labled 'Auth. cerm.,' 'Matching,' and 'Non-matching' corresponds to the questions of 'the purpose of the authentication ceremony' and 'the meaning of the matching or non-matching result.'

On the other hand, many readers simply skim through a research paper to quickly decide on whether they should read the whole paper, then the chart is arguably very incomplete. Not only would it be unclear that each box corresponds to the responses given to different questions, but also the meaning of especially 'matching' and 'non-matching' would be difficult to understand. Furthermore, it would likely take a while for the reader to realize that the text represents the general ideas present in answers that were given the corresponding category, and it would be difficult to argue that all of that text is necessary in the first place. 


### Perceptibility
**Score: 3**. In general, this data visualization requires the readers to compare small numbers to understand the overall takeaway that the authors' redesign resulted in more correct answers. However, some effective choices made were showing the original Signal data in the left column and the redesign in the right column. Not only does this clearly seperate the two types of data, but it also somewhat aligns with the general notion of time advancing towards the right. Furthermore, correct, partically correct, and incorrect are color coded with the appropriate green, yellow, and red colors accordingly. Despite this, actually decoding which warning design is better requires the reader to look at the relatively small, bolded numbers/percentages and compare the two values not only between the two designs, but also between the three questions, which this design makes relatively difficult.

### Truthfulness
**Score: 9**. Overall, this data visualization is accurate and valid. The only slight confusion is that while it seems as though there were 25 paricipants answering questions for the original Signal design and 16 for the redesign, it is unclear and unclarified in the paper why the total number of partically correct responses for the matching question for Signal is 26. 

### Intuitiveness
**Score: 7**. A table is a very familar, simple, and intuitive data visualization. However, as mentioned earlier, it is a unclear that the three section correspond to three different research questions and the user's responses to each.

### Aesthetics
**Score: 3**. There is nothing special or particularly aesthetic about this design. While the colors do add to the visualization, a table is a very plain and simple way to display data.

### Engagement
**Score: 4**. Similarly to aesthetics, there is nothing particularly engaging about a table of words and numbers. While there is not much that distracts from the data, the table's primary purpose seems to be to show the data rather than engage the reader in any meaningful manner. 

### Overall Observations 
Overall, this data visualization adequately showcases the data that the authors of this paper collected during the user studies conducted. Besides including all of the user's individual, complete responses, which would have likely been an overwhelming amount of data, the authors included all data that may be wanted. Furthermore, the overall design of the table is relatively well done, with clean columns and appropriately color-coded rows. 

However, the key aspect of this data visualization that can be improved is the presentation of the data. The key data points are in small numbers that are very difficult to compare, both between the designs and between questions. If I were to do something differently, I would create a visualization that would allow for easier comparisons of the data through the use of, for example, bar charts or scatter plots. This would not only lower the reader's cognitive load, but it would also allow them to quickly verify that the message articulated in the paper is in fact supported by the data. 

### Primary Audience
The primary audience 



Overall, this data visualization adequately showcases the data that the authors of this paper collected during the user studies conducted. Furthermore, the primary takeaway that the authors wanted to convey, that being that their redesign increased user understanding of the authenitcation ceremony using Signal, is directly stated in the paper itself so the table is simply a way to show the data collected that backs up this claim. However, to verify the author's claim, it is quite difficult to compare the small numbers that count the number of partcipants that answered each question correctly, partially correctly, or incorrectly. 

Furthermore, many individuals don't read each paper in detail. Instead, many focus on the abstract, conclusion, and the visualizations to gain a basic understanding of the research conducted and conclusions reached in order to decide if reading the entire paper is worthwhile. In those cases, s
