# Critique by Design


## Chosen Visualization

<img src="resources/Signal_Table_Data_Visualization.png" alt="Table" width="300"/>

The following visualization shows the user testing results performed by Wu et al. in the following research paper: ["Something isn't secure, but I'm not sure how that translate into a problem": Promoting autonomy by designing for understanding in Signal](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2019/presentation/wu). In summary, Wu et al. sought to demonstrate how their redesign of Signal's warning notifications improves user comprehension and empowers them "to make personal trade-offs between percieved risk and response cost." This data visualization is presented to showcase their positive findings.

## Critique

### Usefulness
**10**. Overall, this data visualization is very useful. Since this is a part of a research paper, the primary use of this table is for the authors to be able to back up their claims with concrete numbers. As mentioned in the paper, "This table reveals that comprehension of the purpose of the authentication ceremony and of the significance of matching and non-matching numbers visibly improved with our redesign." Therefore, by showing how more users recieved correct answers for their redesign when compared to Signal, this table adequately accomplishes the author's goals.

### Completeness
**4**. The completeness of this data visualiaztion depends on the audience. If the audience is someone who read the entire paper and sees this chart after being directed to it in the paper and given a thorough explanation (for example, 'see Table 2'), then the table is relatively complete. It shows, for the three types of questions asked, how many users, both actual numbers and percentages, answered correctly, partially correctly, and incorrectly for both designs. However, it would likely take the reader a few moments to realize that each of the three boxes labled 'Auth. cerm.,' 'Matching,' and 'Non-matching' corresponds to the questions of 'the purpose of the authentication ceremony' and 'the meaning of the matching or non-matching result.'

On the other hand, many readers simply skim through a research paper to quickly decide on whether they should read the whole paper, then the chart is arguably very incomplete. Not only would it be unclear that each box corresponds to the responses given to different questions, but also the meaning of especially 'matching' and 'non-matching' would be difficult to understand. Furthermore, it would likely take a while for the reader to realize that the text represents the general ideas present in answers that were given the corresponding category, and it would be difficult to argue that all of that text is necessary in the first place.
