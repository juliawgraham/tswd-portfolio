# Critique by Design


## Chosen Visualization

<img src="resources/Signal_Table_Data_Visualization.png" alt="Table" width="300"/>

The following visualization shows the user testing results performed by Wu et al. in the following research paper: ["Something isn't secure, but I'm not sure how that translate into a problem": Promoting autonomy by designing for understanding in Signal](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2019/presentation/wu). In summary, Wu et al. sought to demonstrate how their redesign of Signal's warning notifications improves user comprehension and empowers them "to make personal trade-offs between percieved risk and response cost." This data visualization is presented to showcase their positive findings.

## Critique

### Usefulness
**10**. Overall, this data visualization is very useful. Since this is a part of a research paper, the primary use of this table is for the authors to be able to back up their claims with concrete numbers. As mentioned in the paper, "This table reveals that comprehension of the purpose of the authentication ceremony and of the significance of matching and non-matching numbers visibly improved with our redesign." Therefore, by showing how more users recieved correct answers for their redesign when compared to Signal, this table adequately accomplishes the author's goals.
