<img src="resources/Signal_Table_Data_Visualization.png" alt="Table" width="300"/>

The following visualization shows the user testing results performed in in the following research paper: ["Something isn't secure, but I'm not sure how that translate into a problem": Promoting autonomy by designing for understanding in Signal](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2019/presentation/wu). In summary, Wu et al. sought to demonstrate how their redesign of Signal's warning notifications improves user comprehension and empowers them "to make personal trade-offs between percieved risk and response cost." This data visualization is presented to showcase their positive findings.
