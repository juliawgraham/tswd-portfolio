# About Me
Hello! I am Julia, and I am currently majoring in Information Systems with a minor in Human Computer Interaction. I am interested in the entire software development lifecycle, including UI/UX design, web development, and testing. More generally, I am interested in a user-centered approach towards technology, and therefore I am intrigued by how visualizations can be designed so that a story based on data is presented to the audience in an engaging and clear manner.

# What I Hope to Learn
- How to elevate a visualization from simply a graph to a full story
- How to properly leverage a variety of technical tools to create visualizations
- Although I will focus more on software development/quality/engineering after I graduate, data and visualizing that data is still a skill I will likely utilize, whether that is by creating my own data-driven stories to present my findings to others or by understanding the visualizations of others
