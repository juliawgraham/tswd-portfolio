# Importance of Testing in Software Development - Part II

# Wireframes / Storyboards
Initial draft: [Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/c7d0a194-21f9-4cf8-a40d-0eb489e14d6c/index.html). 

My first step when creating this initial draft was to outline the key aspects of the story. When doing this, I found that the data I had was not enough to emphasize why software testing is important. Therefore, I decided to add two stories of major project failures and emphasized how testing could have at the least minimized those failures. I also changed my call to action, based on feedback from part I, to mention ways to incorporate testing in other fields. While the focus of this story is on software testing, this addition to the call to action helps make this story more relevant to other readers. 

Then, after finalizing the story I wanted to tell, I found more data sources and created all of the needed data visualizations in Tableau. All of the data was extracted from the various research papers and reports and inputted by hand into Excel. Finally, I added more text and images to help the story flow from one visualization to another. 

# User Research 

## Target Audience
My target audience is primarily those working directly with software, whether they are software engineers or project managers. However, I wanted this story to at least be interesting for non technical individuals. 

For the user tests, I wanted one software engineer, one individual with some coding experience, and someone who has minimal to no technical knowledge. While the software engineer would represent my primary audience, I was also interested in getting feedback on the impact and clarity of the story from a non technical reader. This feedback would be particularly important, as it would provide a vastly different viewpoint from my more technical perspective. Fortunately, I had a few friends who fit in each of these three categories and were willing to participate in a user study.

## Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |

| What did they initially think of this story/topic? | What was your first impression? |
| Did the story impact them in any way? | Did that first impression change? |
| Did the user get something from this story? Did they feel as though they were a part of the intended audience? | Did you find this topic interesting? Relevant? |
|  |  |
| What should I likely not change? | What was your favorite aspect of the story as a whole? |
| What stood out as something to change? | In general, was there anything you would want changed or added? | 
|  |  |
| Does the story look good? | What did you think of the aesthetics, including color, font, layout, etc? |
|  |  |
| What worked with the visualizations? | Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) that you particularly liked? |
| Did the visualizations adequately add to the story? | Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) you would want changed or removed? |
| Are there enough visualizations? | Were there any parts of the story where you wish there was a data visualization but wasn't? |
|  |  |
| Is anything unclear or confusing? | Were there any parts where you wish there was more text/explanation? | 
| Is the amount of text overwhelming or unnecessary? | Were there any parts where you wish there was less text/explanation? | 
|  |  |
| Give the user an opportunity to mention any final comments | Anything else you would like to add? |

In class notes:
- big text for stats in stories
- make bar charts 'thicker' (maybe vertical instead of horizontal)
- add legend (or something) to make it clearer what each color means


- note: add references to the charts (bottom?)

- Assignment 2 notes
-- export data from console (serial monitor) into some text file
-- then plot somehow (python?) - so you can see how the data looks like
-- after some filtering (like in assignment 1), there will be peaks, etc. that will differentiate shapes (look at paper if can find it??)
