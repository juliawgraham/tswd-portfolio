# Importance of Testing in Software Development - Part II

## Wireframes / Storyboards
Initial draft: [Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/c7d0a194-21f9-4cf8-a40d-0eb489e14d6c/index.html). 
This draft is also embedded at the end of this writeup. 

My first step when creating this initial draft was to outline the key aspects of the story. When doing this, I found that the data I had was not enough to emphasize why software testing is important. Therefore, I decided to add two stories of major project failures and emphasized how testing could have at the least minimized those failures. I also changed my call to action, based on feedback from part I, to mention ways to incorporate testing in other fields. While the focus of this story is on software testing, this addition to the call to action helps make this story more relevant to other readers. 

Then, after finalizing the story I wanted to tell, I found more data sources and created all of the needed data visualizations in Tableau. All of the data was extracted from the various research papers and reports and inputted by hand into Excel. Finally, I added more text and images to help the story flow from one visualization to another. 

## User Research 

### Target Audience
My target audience is primarily those working directly with software, whether they are software engineers or project managers. However, I wanted this story to at least be interesting for non technical individuals. 

For the user tests, I wanted one software engineer, one individual with some coding experience, and someone who has minimal to no technical knowledge. While the software engineer would represent my primary audience, I was also interested in getting feedback on the impact and clarity of the story from a non technical reader. This feedback would be particularly important, as it would provide a vastly different viewpoint from my more technical perspective. Fortunately, I had a few friends who fit in each of these three categories and were willing to participate in a user study.

|  |  |

|  |  |
| What worked with the visualizations? | Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) that you particularly liked? |
| Did the visualizations adequately add to the story? | Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) you would want changed or removed? |

|  |  |
| Is anything unclear or confusing? | Were there any parts where you wish there was more text/explanation? |

|  |  |
| Give the user an opportunity to mention any final comments | Anything else you would like to add? |

## In Class Peer Review Findings
Before officially conducting interviews, I received insightful peer feedback from two classmates on an early version of the Shorthand draft. Below are some key insights:
- Make bar charts 'wider', perhaps by making them vertical instead of horizontal, so the data is easier to see (completed before interviews began)
- Add a legend to make it clearer what each color means (completed before interviews began)
- Use big text for the statistics in the stories so it stands out more

### Interview Findings

- Interview 1: Material science and engineering major with a computer science minor
- Interview 2: Computer science major
- Interview 3: Neuroscience major with no computer science knowledge

| Questions | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| What was your first impression? | Thought it was an interesting topic as everyone knows about testing but many don't take it entirely seriously | Sounds like an interesting topic and looks aesthetically pleasing | Looks put together |
| Did that first impression change? | Not really, but did feel very focused on software engineers and those who lead them | Found it very educational and appreciated the focus on an overlooked topic | Consistently looked good |
| Did you find this topic interesting? Relevant? | Found the introductory statistics about how exactly testing is overlooked to be very interesting/surprising (called out the first pie chart about half of the projects not having tests), but did not find the rest that relevant as they don't want to be a software engineer | Found it interesting since they never really read anything that focused on testing this way, and found it quite relevant given their want to become a software engineer | Did not find it that relevant but the colors and short paragraphs did help with engagement |
|  |  |  |  |
| In general, what was your favorite aspect of this story? | Like how the story was built around the data and especially liked the stories of the major failures | Like the real world stories and how it clearly showed what can go wrong with bad software | Liked the big heading over the pictures as well as the highly interactive charts |
| In general, was there anything you would want changed or added? | Found it strange that most of the text simply reiterated the same statistics as shown in the charts, so it felt very repetitive | No | Not really, except that sometimes after manipulating the chart a lot, it was difficult to go back to the original layout |
|  |  |  |  |
| What did you think of the aesthetics, including color, font, layout, etc? | Thought it looked very clean, and especially liked the monospace coding font, but did think the gold text within the paragraphs was a link at first | Liked the gray and gold combination throughout, and how that added to the minimalism of the visualizations | Overall, the formatting helped with engagement, and especially liked how the color carried over to the quotes and highlighted text |
|  |  |  |  |
| Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) that you particularly liked? | Liked the clean aesthetic and particularly liked the 'poor testing practices' chart, as they felt like it nicely provided numbers to the phenomena described in the text | As above, the clean/minimalist color scheme, as well as the descriptive yet concise titles | As above, liked the cohesive colors and ability for interactions, but otherwise, the charts are very standard which helped with understanding |
| Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) you would want changed or removed? | Besides the repetition between the text and the visualizations, they also noted that the same structure (specifically the stacked bar chart) got tiring by the end | No | Sometimes, the key was too long so everything could not have been read and sometimes it was difficult to go back to a previous state after interacting with the chart a lot |
| Were there any parts of the story where you wish there was a data visualization but there wasn't? | No | No | No |
|  |  |  |  |
| Were there any parts where you wish there was more text/explanation? | No, and noted that they liked the shorter paragraphs | No | Besides the keys, no |
| Were there any parts where you wish there was less text/explanation? | Besides the repetition, they also found that the next steps section to be an overwhelming amount of text, but assumed that it was designed like that so readers could more easily find the section most relevant to them | Perhaps slightly less text but found it overall very interesting to read | No, liked the short, separated paragraphs |
|  |  |  |  |
| Anything else you would like to add? | No | Liked the high quality, relevant pictures | No |

## Identified Changes for Part III

| Research synthesis | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Statistics in the stories did not stand out | Repeat the key statistics in a bigger font |
| Non technical users did not find it relevant | Perhaps emphasize the importance of testing and quality assurance in general for all fields earlier in the story (besides the next steps) |
| A lot of text that was slightly overwhelming | Minimize the amount of text and focus on key information |
| The text and visualizations felt very repetitive | Remove repetitive data from the text and instead shorten the paragraphs or focus on new information that builds off of the charts |
| The next steps section was slightly overwhelming | Change the format or lessen the amount of text |
| Citations are not complete | Create APA style citations |

Overall, the feedback was very helpful and showed me both what was successful and what changes need to be made for part III.
