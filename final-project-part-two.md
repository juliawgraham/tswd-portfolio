# Importance of Testing in Software Development - Part II


# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

Interview Questions:
- What was your first impression?
- Did that first impression change?
- Did this story change anything about your opinions on testing?
- Did you find this topic interesting? Relevant? 

- What was your favorite aspect of the entire story?
- Is there anything you would want changed or added?

- What did you think about the aesthetics, including the color, font, layout, etc?

- Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) that you particularly liked?
- Were there any data visualizations (or aspects of) you would want removed or changed?
- Were there any parts of the story where you wish there was a data visualization but wasn't?

- Were there any parts where you wish there was more text/explanation?

In class notes:
- big text for stats in stories

- add legend (or something) to make it clearer what each color means


- note: add references to the charts (bottom?)

- Assignment 2 notes
-- export data from console (serial monitor) into some text file
-- then plot somehow (python?) - so you can see how the data looks like
-- after some filtering (like in assignment 1), there will be peaks, etc. that will differentiate shapes (look at paper if can find it??)
